    <h3 class="Harry_Potter"> Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (2001) </h3>
    <br>
    <p>What happens in the book: After murdering Harry's parents, James and Lily Potter, evil Lord Voldemort puts a killing curse on Harry, then just a baby. The curse inexplicably reverses, defeating Voldemort and searing a lightning-bolt scar in the middle of the infant's forehead. Harry is then left at the doorstep of his boring but brutish aunt and uncle, the Dursleys.</p>
    <p>For 10 years, Harry lives in the cupboard under the stairs and is subjected to cruel mistreatment by Aunt Petunia, Uncle Vernon and their son Dudley. On his 11th birthday, Harry receives a letter inviting him to study magic at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.</p>
    <p>Harry discovers that not only is he a wizard, but he is a famous one. He meets two best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, and makes his first enemy, Draco Malfoy. At Hogwarts the three friends are all placed into the Gryffindor house. Harry has a knack for the school sport, Quidditch, and is recruited onto the Gryffindor team as its star Seeker.</p>
    <p>Perusing the restricted section in the library, Harry discovers that the Sorcerer's Stone produces the Elixir of Life, which gives its drinker the gift of immortality. After realizing that Voldemort might be after the stone, Albus Dumbledore had it moved it to Hogwarts for safekeeping.</p>
    <p>Harry finds out that when she died, Lily Potter transferred to her son an ancient magical protection from Voldemort's lethal spells. This protection is what allowed Harry as an infant to survive Voldemort's attack. It also helps Harry keep Voldemort from possessing the Stone, which Dumbledore agrees to destroy.</p>

    <h3 class="Harry_Potter"> Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002) </h3>
    <br>
    <p>What happens in the book: After a summer spent with the Dursleys, Harry is excited to return to Hogwarts. An unexpected visitor, the house elf Dobby, tries in vain to prevent Harry from returning to Hogwarts by getting him to illegally perform magic outside of the school.</p>
    <p>The Ministry of Magic blames Harry anyway, and the Dursleys confiscate Harry's books and wand. Uncle Vernon puts bars on Harry's windows, imprisoning him in his room. Fred and George Weasley, Ron's brothers, rescue Harry from 4 Privet Drive with their father's flying car. Harry spends the remainder of the summer at the Weasleys' cramped but cozy home.</p>
    <p>When Harry returns to Hogwarts, he realizes he has developed a cult following. Fellow student Colin Creevy constantly takes pictures of him; Ginny Weasley, Ron's sister, seems to have developed a crush on Harry; and professor Gilderoy Lockhart, a pompous wizard, boasts about Harry's accomplishments and their nonexistent rapport.</p>
    <p>The trouble begins when someone opens the Chamber of Secrets, hidden under the dungeons of Hogwarts. The Chamber is home to a Basilisk, a snake-like monster that attacks Muggle-born students, turning them into stone. Browsing through the restricted section in the library archives, Ron, Hermione and Harry learn that the Chamber was built by Salazar Slytherin and can be opened only by his pure-blood heir. Harry fears that he himself may be Slytherin's heir since he can speak the snake language, Parseltongue.</p>
    <p>Ginny disappears and Ron, Hermione and Harry try to find her. Soon Harry and Ginny are trapped in the Chamber of Secrets with the Basilisk. Fawkes, Dumbledore's faithful phoenix, delivers the Sorting Hat to Harry, who draws the sword of Gryffindor from it. With the sword, Harry blinds and maims the Basilisk, which manages to bite Harry at the last minute. Dying from the Basilisk's poison, Harry is revived by Fawkes' rejuvenating tears.</p>
    <p>It turns out that Ginny had opened the Chamber of Secrets under the guidance of Voldemort, who controlled her through his enchanted diary. Gilderoy Lockhart is revealed as a fraud. Dobby is Lucius Malfoy's elf and was trying his best to protect Harry from harm. Dumbledore puts to rest any suspicion that Harry is Slytherin's heir and makes his famous comment: "It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities." Harry could not have wielded the sword of Gryffindor if he did not truly belong to that house.</p>

    <p>What happens in the book: Harry ends another insufferable summer at the Dursleys and hears about an escaped murderer, Sirius Black, in the Muggle news. The wizarding world is also buzzing about the infamous Sirius, who had been held at Azkaban, a maximum-security prison for those who have committed severe crimes.</p>
    <p>Mr. Weasley warns Harry that Sirius is after him. At Hogwarts, Dumbledore informs students that the school will be guarded by the dreaded Dementors, Azkaban guards who can suck the souls out of wizards</p>
    <p>Hermione exhibits strange behavior and seems to be enrolled in every single class, even those with conflicting times. Harry, Hermione and Ron enroll in Professor Trelawny's Divination class and Hagrid's Care of Magical Creatures class.

    <p>When he learns that Sirius betrayed his parents and are to blame for their death, Harry vows to kill him. But Harry soon discovers that Peter Pettigrew — once a good friend to Harry's parents and Sirius — was in fact responsible for betraying the Potters' whereabouts to Voldemort. Sirius, it turns out, is actually Harry's godfather.The Dementors find Sirius and are about to suck his soul when Hermione magically turns back time. Harry then conjures a powerful Patronus charm to save Sirius.

    <br>
    <p>What happens in the book: At the beginning of Harry's fourth year, Hogwarts students are told they will hold the once famous Triwizard Tournament, hosting witches from Beauxbatons Academy and wizards from the Durmstrang Magical Institute.</p>
    <p>The Goblet of Fire selects a student to compete from each school. This year, however, two contestants are selected from Hogwarts: Cedric Diggory and Harry. Along with the other competitors (Viktor Krum, Fleur Delacour), they must race to complete three tasks. Task one: snatch a golden egg from a nest guarded by a deadly dragon. Task two: retrieve something valuable from the bottom of the Hogwart's lake. Task three: make way through a trap-laden labyrinth and retrieve the Triwizard Cup.</p>
    <p>During the second task, Harry falls behind after valiantly saving Fleur Delacour's sister. After trading hints about the first and second tasks, Harry and Cedric work together to complete the third and final task. When they reach the Cup, they grab it at the same time. The cup, it turns out, is a portkey, and Harry and Cedric are transported to a graveyard, where they're welcomed by Voldemort and a slew of Death Eaters.</p>
    <p>Voldemort has Cedric killed immediately and reveals that Harry's advancement in the tournament was pre-planned. Wormtail (formerly Scabbers) obtains some of Harry's blood and uses it in a revival ritual to restore Voldemort's human form and wizarding powers. Harry duels with Voldemort before grabbing the Cup and transporting to Hogwarts. The fanfare of the tournament ends when Harry returns with Cedric's body.</p>

     <p>What happens in the book: The seventh and final installment in the Harry Potter series opens with a dark scene at the Malfoys', where Voldemort is awaiting Snape's report on Harry's whereabouts. The Dark Lord is back in power, and his reach threatens even those in the Muggle world; at No. 4 Privet Drive, Harry convinces his aunt and uncle to go into hiding. As the family departs, Dudley thanks Harry for saving his life. The Order of Phoenix arrives to escort Harry to safety, but they are attacked by Death Eaters. Harry, Hermione and Ron apparate to the Burrow, home of the Weasleys.</p>
     <p>While the Weasleys prepare for Bill and Fleur Delacour's wedding, Harry, Ron and Hermione strategize ways to destroy the five remaining Horcruxes. To their surprise, they discover that Dumbledore, the beloved headmaster of Hogwarts, has left them items in his will: Hermione, a children's book; Ron, a Deluminator; and Harry, Gryffindor's sword and a Golden Snitch. Bill and Fleur's wedding reception is ambushed by Death Eaters, and Harry, Ron and Hermione barely escape. They start on their quest to find the first Horcrux on their list, Salazar Slytherin's locket, and steal the Gryffindor sword from the Ministry of Magic. They find out the sword is a fake, but they manage to steal the locket from Dolores Umbridge.</p>
     <p>Forced into hiding, their ultimate destination unknown, the three former Hogwarts students live like nomads, sleeping in a different place every night. Their straitened circumstances lead to frequent quarrels, and one cold day Ron and Harry have an epic fight, which ends with Ron deserting them. Harry and Hermione are crushed but continue their journey. They decide to go to Harry's birth town, Godric's Hollow, in search of clues and inspiration. But they are attacked there by Voldemort's snake, Nagini, who has assumed the shape of the witch historian Bathilda Bagshot (whom Voldemort has killed). They survive, but Harry is devastated when Hermione tells him his wand has been destroyed during the fight.</p>
     <p>During their travels, Harry and Hermione also meet Dumbledore's brother and learn the story of their sister. They are surprised to learn that Dumbledore aspired for great power during his youth. Harry is crushed by the new information about his idol. He and Hermione continue to hunt for Gryffindor's sword. One night, in a stupor, Harry is led to a pond where he sees the sword and attempts to claim it. Harry's locket Horcrux tries to choke him, but Ron suddenly appears, saves Harry, and destroys the locket with the sword.</p>
     <p>On a hunch, Hermione leads the three to Xeno Lovegood's house, and they learn the story of the three magical talismans that make up the Deathly Hallows: the Elder Wand, a stone that brings back the dead, and the true Invisibility Cloak, which later is revealed to be Harry's cloak. Whoever possesses all three is the Master of Death and gains eternal life. Harry is faced with a tough choice: continue with his original quest to find and destroy the Horcruxes, thus ultimately destroying Voldemort, or chase the Hallows in search of eternal life. But when Harry discovers that Voldemort is in search of the Elder Wand, it becomes clear to him that he must focus on the Horcruxes.</p>
     <p>Every night, Harry and his friends are encouraged by the broadcasts on "Potterwatch," a secret radio station for supporters of the boy wizard. Through teamwork, Harry and his friends find two more Horcruxes: a Hufflepuff cup in the Gringott's vault and Ravenclaw's diadem, in search of which they travel back to Hogwarts at last.</p>
     <p>At Hogwarts, Harry, Ron and Hermione reunite with the rest of Dumbledore's Army, and a battle erupts. Fred Weasley dies, and the tiara burns in a fire. Ron and Hermione destroy the cup with poisonous Basilik venom. One Horcrux remains: the snake, Nagini.</p>
     <p>Reading Voldemort's mind, Harry finds Voldemort in the Shrieking Shack with Severus Snape. Voldemort kills Snape, believing that it will give him the power of the Elder Wand. Before Snape dies, he gives Harry his memories. Harry is surprised to learn that Snape was always loyal to Dumbledore and always loved his mother Lily. Harry realizes that part of Voldemort is inside him, and for Voldemort to die, Harry must die.</p>
     <p>Harry confronts Voldemort, and suddenly Harry is with Dumbledore. Dumbledore tells Harry that the piece of Voldemort that lived inside him is dead, and he can either stay or return and fight. Harry chooses to fight. In their final battle, Harry, the true master of the Elder Wand, defeats Voldemort.</p>
     <p>The trio heads back to Dumbledore's office, and Harry gives up the Elder Wand. Peace is restored.</p>
     <p>An epilogue reveals that Harry's scar has not hurt in 19 years. Ron and Hermione are married. Harry and Ginny are married. They have three children, Lily, James and Albus.
